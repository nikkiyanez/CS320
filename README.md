How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my code is functional by writing and running unit tests that verify each method performs as expected. I use JUnit testing to validate inputs, outputs, and error handling. To maintain security, I implement input validation, restrict data modification where necessary, and follow best practices such as using immutable IDs and checking for null values. Regular code reviews and exception handling also help prevent vulnerabilities and maintain reliability.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by analyzing software requirements and translating them into specific features and test cases. For example, when users require a contact or task management system, I ensure the application allows secure creation, updating, and deletion of data while enforcing input limits. Clear communication with stakeholders and validating requirements through testing help ensure that the final product aligns with user expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable components. I start by identifying classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them, ensuring each part has a clear purpose. I also prioritize modularity and maintainability so code can be easily updated or extended. Before coding, I plan through pseudocode or UML diagrams to visualize logic flow, and I use testing as part of the design process to confirm that the software meets both functional and quality goals.
